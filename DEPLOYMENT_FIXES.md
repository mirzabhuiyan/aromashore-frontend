# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Build Timeout Due to Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Pages using `getStaticProps` were making API calls during build time, causing timeouts when backend was unavailable.

**Solution**: 
- Added build-time environment checks to prevent API calls during production builds
- Added timeout handling (5 seconds) for API calls
- Added fallback content when API calls fail
- Added revalidation strategy for static generation

### 2. Backend Service Unavailability
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to connect to localhost during production builds.

**Solution**:
- Environment variables now properly configured
- Build process detects production environment and skips API calls
- Fallback content provided when backend is unavailable

### 3. Inefficient Build Process
**Problem**: Multiple API calls during build process without proper error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling and timeouts
- Implemented static fallback content
- Added revalidation strategy to update content when backend is available
- Optimized build configuration

## Files Modified

### Static Pages (Fixed getStaticProps)
- `pages/about.jsx` - Added build-time checks and fallback content
- `pages/terms.jsx` - Added build-time checks and fallback content  
- `pages/privacy.jsx` - Added build-time checks and fallback content
- `pages/faq.jsx` - Added build-time checks and fallback content

### Configuration Files
- `next.config.js` - Added build optimizations and error handling
- `package.json` - Updated scripts for proper deployment
- `config.js` - Environment variable configuration
- `.env` files - Proper environment setup

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel/Netlify
1. Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://primesmell.com/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_IMAGE_BASE=https://primesmell.com/uploads/products/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_DOMAIN=primesmell.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://primesmell.com
   ```

2. Use the build command: `npm run build`

### For Custom Server
1. Set environment variables in your server
2. Run: `npm run build:production`
3. Start: `npm start`

## Build Process Now
1. **Development**: Uses `.env.local` with localhost URLs
2. **Production Build**: Detects production environment and uses fallback content
3. **Runtime**: Pages will fetch fresh content from backend when available
4. **Revalidation**: Static pages will update every hour when backend is available

## Key Improvements
- ✅ No more build timeouts
- ✅ Graceful fallback when backend is unavailable  
- ✅ Proper environment variable handling
- ✅ Optimized build process
- ✅ Static generation with revalidation
- ✅ Error handling and timeouts

The build should now complete successfully even when the backend is not available during build time.
