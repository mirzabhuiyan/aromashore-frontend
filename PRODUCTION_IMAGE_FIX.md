# Production Image Loading Fix

## Issue
The production site at https://primesmell.com/shop is experiencing `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors when loading images, especially on mobile devices. This is caused by the frontend trying to load images from the DigitalOcean Spaces CDN, which is having connectivity issues.

## Root Cause
- Frontend is configured to use DigitalOcean Spaces CDN for images in production
- CDN connectivity issues causing `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors
- Mobile devices are more susceptible to these connectivity issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. Frontend Configuration Changes
- **File**: `config.js`
  - Changed production image loading to use backend instead of CDN
  - Added fallback handling for image loading errors
  - Improved error logging for debugging

- **File**: `next.config.js`
  - Added backend remote patterns for image optimization
  - Added DigitalOcean backend as primary image source
  - Kept CDN as fallback option

- **File**: `components/shop/Product.jsx`
  - Added better error handling for image loading
  - Added lazy loading for better performance
  - Added console logging for debugging

### 2. Backend Configuration Changes
- **File**: `aromashore.js`
  - Changed to always serve static files directly
  - Removed CDN redirect in production
  - Added proper CORS headers for image serving
  - Enhanced cache headers for better performance

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend Changes
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd aromashore-backend

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Serve static files directly in production to avoid CDN issues"

# Deploy to DigitalOcean
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd aromashore-frontend

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Use backend for image loading in production to avoid CDN connectivity issues"

# Deploy to DigitalOcean
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
1. Check that backend is serving images at: `https://aroma-shore-backend-dirk7.ondigitalocean.app:3303/uploads/products/`
2. Test frontend at: `https://primesmell.com/shop`
3. Verify images load properly on mobile devices
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Expected Results
- ✅ Images load from backend instead of CDN
- ✅ No more `net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors
- ✅ Better mobile compatibility
- ✅ Improved error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Faster image loading with proper caching

## Monitoring
- Monitor backend logs for image serving requests
- Check frontend console for any remaining image loading errors
- Test on various mobile devices and network conditions
- Verify CDN fallback works if backend is unavailable

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist, revert to CDN by:
1. Changing `config.js` to use `doSpacesCdnBase` for production
2. Updating `aromashore.js` to redirect to CDN in production
3. Redeploying both frontend and backend
